## Overview
Disney asked us to run a nationwide tour to promote the launch of Iron Man 3. The event was hosted at 6 locations around the UK, and featured a huge 103" plasma screen running a Kinect-based augmented reality experience. Players could "become Iron Man" by having his suit mapped to their bodies on-screen, allowing them to fly around Tony Stark's lab and get some target practice in.

## Results
This campaign was more successful than we could have imagined. The microsite was overwhelmed with people wanting to sign-up and we had hour long queues of people waiting to play at every location.

Disney Stores in the locations experienced sales uplift of up to 150% and the film itself broke UK box office records to become the highest-earning film of 2013.
