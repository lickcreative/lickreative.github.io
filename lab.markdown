Lick’s Innovations Lab is an opportunity for retailers and brands alike to see the most up-to-date technologies in action.
Situated in one room, a variety of retail fixtures and environments are replicated to demonstrate how the innovation we offer can enhance the shopper journey.
Examples of the technologies that can be seen (and heard!) include holographic units, capacitive touch-enabled print, directional sound, audience monitoring and augmented reality — yes you can become Iron Man…
