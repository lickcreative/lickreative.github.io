Brand perception on the part of a consumer plays out at the store shelf. Appeal, disdain or indifference motivate product selection, as the marriage of convenience between brand and retailer works to devise and execute sufficiently capable branding and promotional communications. The arsenal of current shelf-edge instruments is fairly limited, typically including package design, shelf positioning, attractive pricing or some nearby static signs that aim to earn attention.

We have a range of shelf-edge screens specifically developed for the retail shelf: from the simple barcode scanner we produced for Remington (pictured above) to cutom programmed Android tablets, we can cater for your brand.
