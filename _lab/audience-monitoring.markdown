Clients can measure the number of people who walk past the store, the number who come through the front door â€” and this information includes whether or not they went in immediately or were convinced by the shopfront.

Once shoppers are inside the store managers can find out how many of them walked up to the second floor and compare with the number of people who took the journey to the second floor last week.

If more people have gone up this week they'll probably conclude that the marketing banners that they put up towards the beginning of the week are working.
