We can print conductive ink onto paper or plastic, with an adhesive layer over the top. This gives the POS capacitive touch capabilities like a smartphone screen, which means the static print can trigger any electronic device. These interactions include LEDs, motors, embedded speakers or even synced mobile apps via Bluetooth.
