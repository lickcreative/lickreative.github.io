Floor projection is a great way to attract attention and increase dwell time in-store without taking up any extra floorspace. The projections can be interactive, which is very engaging, especially for children. We can also project perspective illusions that create the apperance of a 3D image on the floor. A recent trial in Thailand showed 98% recollection in exit interviews and a dwell time of 2.5 minutes.
