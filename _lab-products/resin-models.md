We can install a sensor onto POS to measure the numbers and breakdown of passersby. This allows for different creatives to be A/B tested to discover which works best with each demographic, or draws the most attention. It can also be used to control a digital display (like the holographic unit), showing the most relevant content for the current demographic looking at the POS.
