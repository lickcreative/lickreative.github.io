Image-recognition apps like Blippar allow us to activate static POS with digital content. Users scan the image with their phones and see digital content overlaid on the real world. Once the content is uploaded, multiple access points can be created for low cost. This means a campaign created for a print magazine can be activated from a poster in-cinema, for example. Scan the image on the right with the Blippar app to see what kind of content is possible.
