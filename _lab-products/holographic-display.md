Using an old technique known as “Pepper’s Ghost” we can create realistic floating holograms within a box. These displays can also be controlled via a tablet, creating an interactive hologram. We usually use them as smaller POS displays, but they can be scaled up for events or live concerts (this technology was used for the famous Tupac appearance at Coachella).
