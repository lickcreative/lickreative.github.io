Beacons use Bluetooth to contact smartphones within a certain radius and trigger notifications. They do however require integration with an app, which can be your own or a third party partner. We can be install these on the gondola ends so that when customers with a certain app walk within a set distance they are pushed special offers or more information about the product.
