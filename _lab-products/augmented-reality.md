Augmented reality is used for experiential events. It allows you to map virtual content onto the real world, creating immersive experiences. Our Hulkbuster Experience allowed players to control Iron Man by moving their own bodies, with their movements mapped to his. We measured the audience engagement (using our audience monitoring tech), which showed that 20k people played the game, and 205k watched them play.
