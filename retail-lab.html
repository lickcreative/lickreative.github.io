Lick's Retail Lab is an opportunity for retailers and brands alike to experience the most up-to-date retail technologies in action. Situated in one room, a variety of retail fixtures and environments are replicated to demonstrate how we create exciting, unusual and unforgettable ways to engage your shoppers at every stage of their journey to purchase. Importantly we also show you technologies that let you measure and monitor your actual engagement metrics.

Technologies that can be seen, heard and smelt (!) include holographic units, touch-enabled print, directional sound, audience monitoring and virtual & augmented reality — yes, you can become Iron Man…
